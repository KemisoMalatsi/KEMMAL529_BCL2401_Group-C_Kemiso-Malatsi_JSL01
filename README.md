## Description:

I created a JavaScript function that checks if the user has entered valid pet adoption details. The function takes a string as input and validates if it follows a specific syntax, starting with "pet_" followed by a combination of letters and numbers. If the input follows the syntax, the function must return "Valid Syntax"; otherwise, return "Invalid Syntax."
